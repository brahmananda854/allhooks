GIT & GIT HUB
************************************
1. Version control system is a tools that helps to track chnages in code
Its popular free and open source and fast and scalable

2.It help us to collaborate in team to develop code with out any overwrite

3. GITHUB
**********
Website that allows developers to store and managetheir code using GIT.
Folder like structure called reposetory or repo
to create profile use gmail/emil ID
in this website go to your repository and crete new repo with public or private
initial commit means your first time changes that tracks GIT

4.ADD and commit -->Add means to stage the changes and commit means 
to take the screenshot or store version. 

Setting up Git

VS code
GIT Bash

git --version ----->>> to check the version of GIT

5.Configure GIT
********
git config --global user.name "github name"
git config --global user.email "bdash004@gmail.com(git account email)"
git config --list
~ root folder root directory

7.go to terminal of VS code 
Clone and status
***************************
Local ---Laptop or computer
Remote --- GUTHUB account(repo)
Clone --Cloning a repo on our local machine from github account
git clone "https://github.com/brahmnanda"  it will fetch all folders to local folder
status -- display the staus of code 
git status
cd(change directory)
to go back cd..
to see all files ls
to see hidden files ls -a
if we modify the file in our local machine then it will show mdified
so to commit it we need to do add and commit

8. Status of files in GIT
****************************
untracked--means files are not tracked by git and changes are only in local machine
modified---means changes are modified and tracked by git 
staged ---file is added and staged for commit
unmodified---files are unchanged
change with existing files means modified and new file untracked
Add (staged)
commit(files are unchanged and git took the screenshot)
git add filename (git add .) to add all files at once
git commit -m "your messages"

9.your banch is ahead of existing branch means we have already taken the 
screenshot and it is diffrent from github.com code so to make it we use push cmd
from local to remote
git push origin main

origin main is the default repo and main is the branch name 
we will bydefault push to origin main

10.Now suppose we want to push newly created local machine codes to github.com
we use Init command
init - used to create new got repo
git init (will create a new repo in local machine)
git add .
git commit -m "Initial files message"

to push to github.com we will crete a new repo in github.com 

now  to connect with git hub in VS code in local machine
--git remote add origin https://github.com/mycode1/localrepo.git 

to verify remote--- remote -v

git branch(to check branch) diffrent develpoers crete diffrent branches and work 
accordingly

11. to rename Branch --git branch -M main
now our branch renamed to main branch
git push -u origin main ( if we want to push to origin main later on then we use -u)

12. WORKFLOW
***********************
Local Git 

Github repo-->clone-->changes -->add-->commit--->push


13. GIT Branches
*******************
suppose we want to work on diffrent features of code then we will create separate
branches then work on it then mearge to master later on
to check branch --- git branch 
to change name -- git -m main
---git checkout branchname (to navigate to new branch)
---git checkout -b branchname(to create new branch)
---git branch -d branchname(to delete branch) note--we cannot delete the branch on which 
we are currently checkout to 
we want to push to github.com --git push origin feature1


14.IF we want to mearge with main branch to feature branches then (2 ways)
---git diff otherbranch 
---git mearge currentbranch

second way is to create Pull Reqest(PR)

Pull Request --- It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch
in a repository on git hub
my branch ---->>>> main Branch (review our PR by manager)

on GITHUB click compare and pull request to to mearge your feature1 codes with main or vice versa
 Now the changes will appear on guthub but not on local machine for main branchs
to get the code in local machine
---git pull origin main (used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update
the local repo to match that content)

15. Resolving merge conflicts
********************************************
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve diffrences in code betwwen two commits
---git mearge main
mearge conflicts will be there which automatically VS code cannot resolve 
so we need to finalize which one to keep

16.UNDoing changes
*********************

case 1 : staged changes
---git reset filename
---git reset

case 2 : commited changes (for one commit)
---git reset HEAD~1  (reset head to 1 step)

case 3 : commited changes (for many commits)
---git reset <--commit hash-->
---git reset --hard  <--commit hash-->  to get back to 3 step then copy and paste the hashvalue
git log (shows hash keys)


17.FORK
*************
completely rough copy of another project 
we want to completely copy and paste repo then we will do fork
if we want to put our changes to that persons code then we will do pull request
